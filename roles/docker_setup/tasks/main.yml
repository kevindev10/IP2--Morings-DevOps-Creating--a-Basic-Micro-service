# This role sets up Docker Compose orchestration inside the VM.
# It copies a pre-defined docker-compose.yml and optionally runs it.
# Future services (mongo, backend, frontend) will be added to the Compose file.
# ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# 📁 STEP 1: Create target directory for Compose YAML (under app folder)
# - This is where docker-compose.yml will live
# - Future config files or env vars can be added here as needed
- name: Ensure Compose configuration directory exists
  file:
    path: /home/vagrant/app
    state: directory
    mode: '0755'
  tags: [compose, docker_setup]

# 📦 STEP 2: Copy docker-compose.yml to VM
# - The file is stored in docker_setup/files/ locally
# - Gets placed into /home/vagrant/app where Compose runs
# - Currently may contain just MongoDB or be a stubbed version
- name: Copy docker-compose.yml to VM target directory
  copy:
    src: docker-compose.yml
    dest: /home/vagrant/app/docker-compose.yml
    mode: '0644'
  tags: [compose, docker_setup]

# 🚀 STEP 3: Run Docker Compose up (optional)
# - Launches all services defined in docker-compose.yml
# - Detached mode ensures containers keep running in background
# - Will be meaningful once services like mongo/backend/frontend are added
- name: Start services using Docker Compose
  command: docker-compose up -d
  args:
    chdir: /home/vagrant/app      # Run from the directory with Compose file
  tags: [compose, docker_setup]
